# easyPubMed latest dev version

**Note**
At this moment, `easyPubMed` only supports retrieving 10,000 records per query. This is due to some recent changes in the NCBI E-utilities (see: <https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2022/09/13/updated-pubmed-eutilities/>). This is a known issue/limitation. I'll try to re-write the R library to account for the changes in the E-utilities as soon as possible (likely, within a few months). 
Thanks for your patience. I hope I'll push an updated version of easyPubMed by July 2023 (work in progress)...

**Reminder**
- There is only one person maintaining this R package. 
- I work on code updates in my spare time and for free. 
- Take-home message: please, be patient.
